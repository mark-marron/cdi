## Abstract

This report provides an overview of the process of both designing and implementing a configurable ignition control unit aimed
for use in motorcycles produced from around the 1980s to the early 2000s. Ignition for these motorcycles is controlled by a
black box component called a capacitor discharge ignition unit (CDI). 

In general these are sealed units not designed to be repaired or modified. In order to reduce the cost and increase the 
possibility of repair, the new unit aims to be a replacement that can be configured to work on any motorcycle. A profile 
system is implemented that reduces the configuration required when setting up the device for a motorcycle. The profile 
contains critical information that influences how the unit controls ignition signals. This profile concept is explored 
further in order to implement safety features that limit a motorcycles performance in order to facilitate new riders.
